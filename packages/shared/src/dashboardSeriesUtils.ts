/**
 * Build chart points from a `Map` of accumulated values keyed by bucket key.

 * @param buckets  Ordered bucket descriptors (`{ key, label }`) defining the
 *                 x-axis points (e.g. recent months).
 * @param values   Accumulated values keyed by `bucket.key`.
 * @param toPoint  Projects a bucket + its resolved value (or `undefined` when
 *                 the bucket has no records) into a chart point. Callers apply
 *                 their own `?? 0` fallbacks inside the projector.
