 * serious/critical") — which previously had no tooling behind it, so it could
 * not actually be run.
 *
 * Scope choices:
 *  - WCAG 2.1 A + AA rules, matching the `wcag21aa` tag set axe recommends for
 *    a general-purpose app. Adding `best-practice` rules would surface dozens of
 *    style opinions and train people to ignore the gate.
 *  - Only `serious` and `critical` fail the build. `moderate`/`minor` findings
 *    are reported as annotations so they stay visible without blocking deploys —
 *    a gate that fails on trivia gets bypassed.
 *  - Colour-contrast checks are meaningful only in a real rendered browser,
 *    which is exactly why this lives in Playwright rather than a jsdom unit test.

 * explicit: any rule NOT listed here fails the build, so the codebase cannot get
 * worse. Entries are surfaced as annotations on every run so they stay visible
 * rather than quietly forgotten.
 *
 * How each is expected to be removed: fix the underlying markup/design, delete
 * the entry, and let this gate hold the line. Do not add an entry to unblock a
 * change — fix the change instead.

/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A11Y_BASELINE IS NOW EMPTY. Both entries that existed at adoption have been
 * retired, so every serious/critical WCAG 2.1 A/AA violation now fails the build.
 * Keep it that way: if a new violation appears, fix it rather than re-baselining.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `color-contrast` — removed. The gate runs clean across 15 audit contexts (5
 * routes × 2 viewports, 4 overlay dialogs, plus RTL).
 *
 * The root cause was not the markup the entry originally named. Every semantic
 * token is overwritten at runtime by the branding injector, and
 * `ensureAccessibleFillSurface` stopped as soon as EITHER white or dark text
 * passed on the fill — so a mid-tone brand colour that accepts a dark label kept
 * its bright fill (the test tenant resolved `--primary` to #db9d00, 2.37:1 on
 * white) and the token was unusable as text, on surfaces and on its own chip tint.
 * Fills are now fitted to all three roles; see
 * `packages/shared/src/brandingCssContrast.ts` and the three-role assertions in
 * `brandingTheme.test.ts` / `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/designTokens.contrast.test.ts`.
 *
 * `aria-hidden-focus` — removed. This one described itself as "intermittent,
 * ~1 in 6 runs, not attributable to a component". The `ProgressBar` ARIA conflict
 * that was fixed while investigating it (it spread `aria-hidden` onto its own
 * `role="progressbar"`) now looks like the actual cause, on the strength of the
 * absence: ~40 clean dashboard audits since, across 12 full gate runs and a
 * 16-audit focused reload loop, where the old rate was ~1 in 6. That is ~0.1%
 * likely if nothing had changed. The success path is also now better instrumented —
 * failures print the node's `html:` and axe's measured values — so if it does
 * recur, the output names the element.
