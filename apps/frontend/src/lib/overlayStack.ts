/**
 * Overlay layer registry — decides which overlay owns an Escape key.
 *
 * Every dismissible overlay used to attach its own `window` keydown listener and
 * close on Escape unconditionally. With two overlays mounted at once that closed
 * BOTH: `ContactDetail` renders a `ConfirmAlertDialog` inside a
 * `DetailDrawerShell`, so pressing Escape to dismiss the confirm dialog also
 * dismissed the drawer behind it and dropped the user out of the record.
 *
 * Overlays now register when they open and only the topmost one reacts to
 * Escape. Registration is a plain module-level stack (not React state) because it
 * must be readable synchronously from a DOM event handler and must not trigger
 * re-renders.
 *
 * Radix-based overlays (AlertDialog and friends) portal outside the tree that
 * renders them and keep their own Escape handling, so they are not registered
 * here. They are covered by the focus-ownership guard in `useOverlayBehavior`
 * instead — see `isAnotherLayerFocused`.
