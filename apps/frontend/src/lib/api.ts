 * `tsrClient.students.list` degrade to non-callable unions, which led to
 * `@ts-expect-error - TS union discrimination limit` being suppressed at every
 * hook across all modules (~286 sites), erasing query-param and response
 * types exactly where the contract layer was supposed to enforce them.
 *
 * `tsr.students` instantiates `TsRestReactQueryHooksContainer` against the
 * small per-domain contract (`studentContract`), which TS resolves fully:
 * real query/mutation request and response types at every call site. The
 * single cast per domain lives here in this reviewed file; feature code uses
 * `tsr.<domain>.<route>.useQuery/useMutation` — not `tsrClient`.
