 *
 * Why redaction at all: logs are shipped, indexed, retained, and readable by
 * anyone with log access, which is a far broader audience than the API response
 * that legitimately carries a token. A single `logger.error({ err })` on an
 * error object that happens to carry a request body is enough to write a
 * password or bearer token into durable storage.
 *
 * This is DEFENSE IN DEPTH, not a licence to log credentials: code must still
 * avoid passing them in the first place (see `lib/devLogging.ts`).
