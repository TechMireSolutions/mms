/**
 * Gate for logging values that are only acceptable in local development.
 *
 * Some flows generate a one-time credential (2FA code, login-email change code)
 * that a developer needs to read without access to a real mailbox. Logging it is
 * a genuine convenience — but credentials in the log stream are shipped,
 * indexed, and retained, so it must never happen by default.
 *
 * Two conditions, both required:
 *   1. An EXPLICIT local environment (`NODE_ENV` is exactly `development` or
 *      `test`), and
 *   2. An explicit opt-in (`MMS_LOG_DEV_CREDENTIALS=true`).
 *
 * The first condition is an allow-list rather than `!== 'production'` on
 * purpose. "Not production" is a weak signal — a staging box with `NODE_ENV`
 * unset, or set to `staging`, would satisfy it and start writing real user OTPs
 * into durable, widely-readable logs. Unrecognised or missing values fail
 * closed.
