/**
 * Small concurrency primitives shared by long-running DB work.

 * These exist so long-lived operations (whole-workspace snapshot/backup streams,

 * path — `PG_POOL_MAX` defaults to 20 and is shared by every concurrent request
 * — so anything that holds a pooled client for more than a moment needs an
 * explicit budget.
