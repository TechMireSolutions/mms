/**
 * Admission control for long-lived streaming responses.
 *
 * These responses hold a checked-out pooled DB client for their entire duration
 * (see `beginLongLivedTenantTransaction`), which can be minutes for a large
 * workspace. The pool is the scarcest resource in the request path —
 * `PG_POOL_MAX` defaults to 20 and is shared by every concurrent request — so
 * without a cap a handful of concurrent downloads (an admin opening several
 * tabs) would stall every ordinary request until `connectionTimeoutMillis`
 * expires.
 *
 * Excess requests are shed with `503 Service Unavailable` and a `Retry-After`
 * header rather than queueing, so the client can back off explicitly.
